* https://www.aitendo.com/product/18940[1.3" 128x64 OLED display]
* https://www.aitendo.com/product/18401[AT8563 Real Time Clock]
* https://www.aitendo.com/product/16357[BK1080VB FM Receiver]

== Usage
. Wire components together
. Download firmware to the board
. Power up the curcuit to receive the broadcast at 83.5MHz

== Development / build from source
=== Prerequisite
* Rust stable with thumbv7m-none-eabi toolchain
* openocd (Optional)
* arm-none-eabi-objcopy (Optional)
* Any shell (bash is requred for debugging(needs checking))

=== Build
[source, shell]
----
# Debug build
$ cargo build

# Debug on the attached board
$ cargo run

# Create the release firmware
$ ./release.sh
----

== To Do
* Do not panic in peripheral drivers but return results and errors using `Result`
* Add the UI
* Use the radio receivers with disclosed specifications
* Implement clock
* Create driver crates for used I2C peripherals
* Implement register reading in BK1080 driver (requires the transactional I2C transmission feature that is to be implemented in depending crates)
